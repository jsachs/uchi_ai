Naive Bayes

To run the code, simply type 'python main.py'.  This will execute both the test
code used to cross-validate parameters, and classify the unknown documents
using the selected parameters.  While the data used to make selections is
printed to the standard out, tables and discussions are included in
'writeup.pdf'.

The test code will run twice; once for the main assignment, and a second time
for the extra credit (as indicated on the standard out).

While this is mentioned in the writeup, it is worth noting that most values of
gamma seemed to work.  It's unclear if my algorithm was accidentally "too
good", or if I messed something up elsewhere.
