To run the code, type 'python main.py'
This will show a visual test, with a small and large disc,
as well as print the results of several parameter tests.
The paramater results can be seen on the standard out,
and are discussed in the writeup.

While the code is hardcoded to use premade test images, it can be
easily modified within test.py to use other ASCII binary images.

Test images are generated and stores as txt files so their fidelity
can be verified.
