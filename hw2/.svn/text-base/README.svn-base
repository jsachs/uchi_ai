Generalized Tic Tac Toe

The program souce is located in "tic_tac_toe.py".  For testing purposes,
a standard tic tac toe board is located in "regular.txt".

To run the program, type "python tic_tac_toe.py <testfile.txt>".  This will
allow the user to play interactively.  Computer moves first, playing X,
while the user plays O.  Moves are made by entering an integer value from
among the list of valid moves.

It is assumed the User knows the winning paths from the input file.
This allows the game to be played in the most generalized fashion.
