Homework 3

1. To run eigP, type 'python eigP.py <numvecs> <precision> <matrix.txt>'.
It will output a file 'vecs.txt' containing the matrix U, and a file 'vals.txt'
containing the column vector of the corresponding eigenvalues. If k = 1, the
number of iterations will be printed to the standard output.

2. To run svdP, type 'python svdP.py <numvecs> <precision> <matrix.txt>'.
It outputs 'U.txt', 'V.txt', and 'S.txt'.  

The code used to test the Frobenius norm is included at the end of the main,
by simply printing the value to the standard out.  It was tested on the
matrix int 'test1.txt'.  For the chosen matrix, past k=5, it would hang,
when the eigenvalues were zero, I believe.

3. To run genA, type 'python genA.py <numvecs> <probability>'.
It then uses svd to attempt reconstruction, and prints the
resulting Frobenius norm to the standard out.  The results of testing
are presented in the write-up.

4. To perform the latent semantic analysis, we use the code in 'lsa.py'.
To run it, type 'python lsa.py <numvecs>'. This prints the Frobenius norm
of the reconstructed matrix and the original to the standard output.

As it stands, the code has not run to completion on part 4; the matrix
appears to be too large, or does not converge.
