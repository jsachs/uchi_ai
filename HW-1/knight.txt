# This graph represents the moves of the knight chess piece from one corner of a 5x5 chessboard to the opposite corner.
# Each node in the graph is one of the 25 possible positions of the knight on the board, starting from the top-left corner, moving left-to-right and top-to-bottom to the bottom-right corner.
# Your algorithms should find the least-cost path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
