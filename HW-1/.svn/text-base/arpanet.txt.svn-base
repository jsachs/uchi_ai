# This graph represents Arpanet, a precursor to the Internet, with 13 nodes across the US in 1970.
# Edges in this graph are real, but the weights are fictional.
# The rows/columns of the matrix are, in order, Stanford, UCLA, SRI, UCSB, Utah, RAND, SDC, BBN, MIT, Lincoln Labs, Case Western, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard.
# Your algorithms should find the least-cost paths from Stanford to Harvard.
