Homework 7
SVM

To run each problem, type 'python q1.py', 'python q2.py', and 'python q3.py',
respectively.  These files are located in the src directory.

Any relevant output figures are included in the writeup, but are also kept
in the root directory with relevant file names.  The output of running
the code for q3 is stored in a text file due to length.

All other relevant information is in 'writeup.pdf'.

I'll note that I'm not sure how correctly my part 3 operates (since it's
very fast), but it runs.  The answers to the questions posed are shown in the
writeup.

I did not have time to test outlier data points.

As a further addendum, at the time of submission, my code had not finished
running.  I planned to have the above text file completed, but it
did not complete.  Everything mentioned can be reproduced, but
there just wasn't time.
