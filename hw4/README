Perceptrons

To run all of the necessary code for testing and to generate what is in the
write-up, type 'python test.py'.

Source for the perceptrons are in their respective python files.
Testing code is located in the test file.

'linear_online.txt' and 'kernel_online.py' are the files showing mistakes
versus examples seen.  'test200.label.35.linear' and 'test200.label.35.kernel'
are the label files after running the trained perceptrons.

As a not to the grader, I'm not entirely sure that I judged my cross-validation
correctly.  I used the sigma that gave me the best error rate, but I don't
think I ultimately accounted for overfitting.

As another aside, I'm somewhat confident that my batch mode for the kernel
perceptron is wrong.  It was never clean from the class notes how to run
it in iterations, so I took my best shot.
